# HTML Object Tag Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the HTML `object` tag and its behavior when the specified data source is invalid or inaccessible.  The bug manifests as a failure to render the embedded content, resulting in a blank space or a broken image icon where the embedded content should appear.

## Bug Description
The `object` tag, used to embed various types of content,  fails to render properly when the `data` or `src` attribute points to a non-existent or inaccessible file.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. This can include:

1.  Checking the availability of the resource before attempting to embed it using JavaScript.
2.  Providing alternative content or a placeholder message if the resource is unavailable.
3.  Using JavaScript to dynamically handle potential errors during the embedding process.
